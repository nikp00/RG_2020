# Sky racing
This is my final project for the computer graphics class. It's a 3D racing game made from scratch with WebGL. 
The only libraries that it uses are gl-matrix, used mainly for matrix/vector/quaternion operations, and ammo.js which is used for the physics simulation.

You can check out the game by clicking [here](https://nikp00.github.io/RG_2020/).
